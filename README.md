### V2

Version 2.x requires React 16.8 at minimum. For React 15 please use version 1.x.

## Getting Started

ST-UI-Toolkit is available as a public [npm](http://npmjs.org) package. Once you have npm you can install ST-UI-Toolkit in your project folder with:

```
npm install @socialtables/st-ui-toolkit
```

### Import & Use Components

We recommend you get started with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) first. Once you have a simple application setup you can import any component and use it right away. No stylesheets, font or any other prerequisite needed.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="react-root"></div>
    <!--
    You can use browserify, webpack or similar tools
    to compile & combine your JSX code
  -->
    <script src="bundle.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

```javascript
const React = require('react');
const ReactDOM = require('react-dom');
const STUIToolkit = require('@socialtables/st-ui-toolkit');
const Button = STUIToolkit.Button;

class App extends React.Component {
  _clickHandler() {
    alert('YOLO');
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Button onClick={this._clickHandler} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('react-root'));
```

### Learn more

In addition you can dig through the [documentation](http://socialtables.github.io/st-ui-toolkit) to learn about how to add and use components.

## Browser Support

- Chrome (mobile and desktop)
- Safari (mobile and desktop)
- Firefox
- Internet Explorer 9, 10, 11

## Philosophy

As we design the User Interfaces for various products here at Social Tables, we often times run into common patters or components that we end up re-implementing in multiple places. This library allows us to place all of our reusable patterns into a single module that can be used by any Social Table's application.

## Development

You can install the development environment with

```
npm install
```

`npm run build` will trigger a build into the `lib` folder.

### Run the examples or docs application

To run the examples/docs run `npm run storybook`.

As you update the storybook for the docs or the components, the changes will update in real-time within the browser.

### Tests

In order to run the tests use

```
npm test
```

To run the test continuously you can use `npm run test:watch`.

## Future Plans

- Deprecate this.

## Special Thanks

- [Belle](https://github.com/nikgraf/belle) for providing the initial starting point/scaffolding for the repository
- [Julian Haddad (Lead Designer at Social Tables)](http://julianhaddad.com/) for designing most if not all of the components!
